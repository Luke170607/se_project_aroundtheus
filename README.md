# Project 6: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- This project allowed me to showcase my understanding of Javascript, validators, and interface with how to toggle popups and javascript uncaught errors and debugging to create a smooth fully functioning web page. A front-end application that offers users functionality, and smooth transitions between toggling the page editing popups!
