# Project 8: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- This project allowed me to compartmentalize my code in Javascript to break it down by sections, userInfo, entries, and popups to isolate functionality. The goal was to succesfully refactor the majority of the Javascript code and improve on cleaning up the code to improve functionality.

I thoroughly enjoyed implementing new ways to showcase functions and accesability with a more cut and clear re-organized approach to Javascript.
